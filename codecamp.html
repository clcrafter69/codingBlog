            <h2>Cynthia Goes To Camp...Bootcamp That Is...</h2>
            <p>
                But one day, things started to change. We had a change in management and a new direction. I went from enjoying my job to feeling frustrated and trapped. This company was not where I wanted to be anymore. I wanted to leave only to realize that my skills were no longer “hot”. I was essentially a Palm Pilot in a iPhone/Samsung world. 
I had a choice—I could stay and endure or I could leave and start over. Since I was financially secure, I decided to take my marbles and start over. 
How would I start over??? Traditional college was not me. I did not need freshman English classes, Intro to Calculus and all that other crap. I did not need to get “ready for the workforce”—I had worked in corporate America for decades. I did not just want to go the online route either because I knew software development was not a solitary endeavor—it involves team building and collaboration.
After much consideration, I decided to do an intensive coding bootcamp—much more expensive than an online courses but much less than another traditional college degree. I did not just want to learn syntax—I want to build projects. So, although I was not thrilled about going to class and doing homework again, I decided this was the best path for me.
Fast forward a couple of months…..
How do I feel now??
 I am still trying to get used to class and homework. Unlike the first time, I am older with many more family responsibilities. However, when I am able to catch my breath (which is few and far between), I am actually enjoying myself. I am learning something totally out of my comfort zone. My old career is starting to feel new and fresh again—just like it felt all those years ago when I first started.
